<h2>Some more information behind the making of the website</h2>
<br>
    <p class="specialText">
        We created this webstie as we felt it to be important for kids to learn about farm animals and how farms work; which can have huge benefits in aiding their learning and development. We believe itâ€™s important for kids to understand where their food comes from, encouraging more appreciation for their meals, the process of how food ends up on their plates, the issues surrounding this, and learning to be less wasteful. This may even lead to a greater curiosity for a range of foods! Learning about farm animals also introduces children to wildlife; exploring the different needs and types of care animals need, such as food and shelter. It can also be a good way to learn about the circle of life. This also enables opportunities for kids to learn about the importance of nature and weather on farming, and how this affects how farmers work every day. Learning about how to be safe on a farm with lots of animals and machinery will help teach kids how to follow important rules. Finally, teaching kids about farm animals helps children to learn the noises they make, how to pronounce animal names, remembering those names, and then associating them with the correct animal.
